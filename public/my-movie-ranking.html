<h1>The Best Movies According to Alain</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fargo</h3>

<p>The Coen Bros are the best. Perfect film. Great cold snowy atmosphere.</p>

<h3>The Truman Show</h3>

<p>
  Great concept and executions. Very forward thinking in its ideas and great
  direction by Peter Weir. More relevant all the time.
</p>

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>

<p>
  The ultimate crowd pleasing summer blockbuster film. You cant make a dinosaur
  movie without the franchise. A great director teamed up with the most talented
  in visual effects artists and animatronics.
